# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: improper exception handling within asynchronous functions using `async` and `await`. The `bug.dart` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.dart` offers a refined approach.

The issue lies in the inadequate handling of exceptions. While the `catch` block prints the error, it doesn't provide a mechanism for the calling function to understand that the operation failed.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

The solution improves error handling by returning a result indicating success or failure and using a `Future`'s `.catchError()` method for more robust exception management.
